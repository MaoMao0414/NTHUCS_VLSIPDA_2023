# NTHUCS_VLSIPDA_2023
These are homeworks of VLSI Physical Design Automation, NTHU CS course teached by prof. Ting-Chi Wang in fall 2023.
## Homework 1: P&R Tool
Use Cadence Innovus to complete the P&R (Place and Route) flow for a given synthesized standard-cell design.
## Homework 2: Two-way Min-cut Partitioning
Implement Fiducciaâ€“Mattheyses algorithm to solve the problem of two-way min-cut partitioning.
## Homework 3: Fixed-outline Floorplanning with Fixed and Soft Modules
Implement an improved simulation annealing algorithm with B* tree data structure to determine the shape and position of each soft module.
